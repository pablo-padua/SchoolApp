# SchoolApp

<h3>The city hall of a county is struggling to upkeep the data for its public schools. There is already a registration file made in Excel to control schools and their classes, however, the register is always obsolete because there is no centralized control system for these students. The city then hired us to develop an online system where public schools and their respective classes will be registered.</h3>

<h3>It was specified that the system will consist of 2 features: one for listing/registrating schools, and another for listing/registrating the classrooms of each school.
The system should follow the basic precepts of software engineering and object orientation, with a focus on quality, beauty and usability, as well as using the most modern javascript libraries on the market:</h3><br>

* Java 8 and Springboot (2.5.2) was used on the back-end.
* Angular 12.1.1 was used on the front-end.
* PostgreSQL and PgAdmin4 was used for data storage and manipulation.
